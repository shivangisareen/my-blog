I wanted to have a little fun with Python (not that coding in Python isn't all that but wanted to explore more fun use cases!). So I've started looking into **Pygame**.

I've been coding in Python for a long while and now looking at the basics of Pygame, it's very different than anything I've coded. In 4th year college, I initially took up a computer graphics course (but later switched to a different subject) and graphics programming can sure be a task!

Excited to pick this up and let's see where it goes!

Check out my progress with Pygame on [GitHub](https://github.com/shivangisareen?tab=repositories) and try out some of the games!
