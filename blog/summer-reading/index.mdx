What have I been reading since March? Gosh, I can't remember... I had to go back to my "Feb-March Reading" blog post
to see if I had mentioned what I was reading next and there it was. I'm going to be jogging my memory hard to write this one.
Also it's been 4 months since my last blog post!?

Some recommendations coming your way.

**How Beautiful We Were** by **Imbolo Mbue** - although a fiction read, it's a story rooted in reality.
A fictional African village faces the lethal consequences of environmental degradation of their land caused by an
American oil company. It's one long epic battle against greed. The book is hopeful and especially heartbreaking -
it really didn't read like fiction to me; it's powerfully real.
Please read this one.

**The Thursday Murder Club** by **Richard Osman** - what a pleasurable read! A group of friends at a retirement
home start holding Thursday meetings to solve old unsolved murders for fun. The next thing they know, they're in the middle
of solving one in which they're all suspects. Delightful book. It has a sequel that's on my list!

**Beautiful World, Where Are You** by **Sally Rooney** - It's my first Sally Rooney
book so wasn't expecting no speech marks at all. I was pretty confused and saw people online were upset about
this way of writing. But I loved it. A bit difficult to get used to and lots of re-reads of sentences but I totally get
the reason behind this style of writing. It made for a very wonderful, different and uninterrupted reading experience.
The book is not so much about the plot - it's everything else! It shines a beautiful light on imperfections.

**Educated** by **Tara Westover** - heart-stopping. This is the only non-fiction is this list. It's a memoir by Tara Westover
who grew up in rural Idaho in an unusual (an understatement) family. It feels unreal - the stories told by her of her childhood. The storytelling
is so vivid; I was captivated throughout. In awe of Tara Westover's journey. I lack the ability to put into words the extraordinary nature of the book.
I wish I'd read it sooner.

I had picked up **When We Cease to Understand the World** by **Benjam√≠n Labatut** - it started out as a very engrossing read but by towards
the end, it took some weird turn and I couldn't finish it.

Next I'm reading **Normal People** by **Sally Rooney** - I've fallen in love with her writing and excited to read this one as I've heard
all the craze about the novel and, of course, the show.
