Everyone’s favourite feature - dark mode! I had so much fun setting up a dark mode toggle and it’s super easy. 

[`gatsby-plugin-dark-mode`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-dark-mode/) handles most of the implementation right out of the box. 
 
I've written all about the steps on Medium [here](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/setting-up-dark-mode-on-my-personal-website-300eb28c2c5c). I want to keep all my technical blog posts in one location and reach the right audience so do check out Medium!
