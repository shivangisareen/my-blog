I love books! Just today I was reminded of a novel series that my brother and I used to enthusiastically read as kids - 39 Clues. 
That really took me back a good couple of years! 


I wanted to keep track of my reading list and also what I thought about the books I've read. And just today, added two more books to my never-ending and ever-growing list. Here goes.

* A Promised Land 

* How To Avoid A Climate Disaster

* Stakeholder Capitalism

* Becoming

* The Code Breaker

* Elon Musk

* Braiding Sweetgrass

* Gathering Moss

* Human Kind - A Hopeful History

* The Overstory
This book is about 8 strangers that relate to trees.  

* The Body

*
