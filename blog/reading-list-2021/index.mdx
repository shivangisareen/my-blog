I love books! Just today I was reminded of a novel series that my brother and I used to enthusiastically read as kids - *39 Clues*. 
That really took me back a good couple of years.


I wanted to keep track of my reading list and also what I thought about the books I've read. And just today, added two more books to my ever-growing list. Here we go!

This year I've read the following books (except the last one the list which I am currently reading). Reviews of these are in progress and will be published soon!

* **A Promised Land - Barack Obama**

* **How To Avoid A Climate Disaster - Bill Gates**

* **Stakeholder Capitalism - Klaus Schwab and Peter Vanham**

* **Becoming - Michelle Obama**

* **The Code Breaker - Walter Isaacson**

* **Elon Musk - Ashlee Vance**

* **Braiding Sweetgrass - Robin Wall Kimmerer**

* **Gathering Moss - Robin Wall Kimmerer**

* **Human Kind: A Hopeful History - Rutger Bregman**

* **The Overstory - Richard Powers**
  
* **Good Economics for Hard Times - Abhijeet V. Banerjee & Esther Duflo**
