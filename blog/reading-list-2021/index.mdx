I love books! Just today I was reminded of a novel series that my brother and I used to enthusiastically read as kids - _39 Clues_.
That really took me back a good couple of years.

I wanted to keep track of my reading list and (maybe) add some thoughts about the books I read. And just today, added two more books to my ever-growing list. Here we go!

This year I've read the following books (except the last one on the list which I am currently reading).

- **A Promised Land** - **Barack Obama**

- **How To Avoid A Climate Disaster** - **Bill Gates**

- **Stakeholder Capitalism** - **Klaus Schwab and Peter Vanham**

- **Becoming** - **Michelle Obama**

- **The Code Breaker** - **Walter Isaacson**

- **Elon Musk** - **Ashlee Vance**

- **Braiding Sweetgrass** - **Robin Wall Kimmerer**

- **Gathering Moss** - **Robin Wall Kimmerer**

- **Human Kind: A Hopeful History** - **Rutger Bregman**

- **The Overstory** - **Richard Powers**

- **Good Economics for Hard Times** - **Abhijeet V. Banerjee** & **Esther Duflo**
