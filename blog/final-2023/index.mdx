I picked up a number of books second half of 2023 but could/did not finish all.

**Trust** by **Hernan Diaz** - I've heard great things about the book but could not stay engaged.
However, I’m going to give this one another try this year.

**Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow** by **Gabrielle Zevin** is an amazing book and I highly
recommend! I finished this one so fast; it was such a page turner. The story is about two childhood
friends, Sam and Sadie, whose paths cross unexpectedly, leading them on a journey rediscovering what
sparked their friendship in the first place - video games! Sam has a disability and for him, video
games are an escape into a world where he’s strong and able, infinite respawns and possibilities.
Together, they start a business creating games. This starts an epic story of friendship, love,
heartbreak and surely you’ll be hooked. I absolutely loved the parts where they talk about ideas
for their games and the technicalities. I was also playing **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
Kingdom** at the time and so the timing was perfect! And no, you don’t have to be a gamer head to
read this one, but you are very likely to be drawn to the imaginative and endless world of
video games, which the title of the book perfectly describes.

- **All the Light We Cannot See** by **Anthony Doerr**

- **The Island of Missing Trees** by **Elif Shafak**

- **Fourth Wing** by **Rebecca Yarros**

Here’s a list of three books I started but did/could not finish. The first two I'm DEFINITELY
going to pick up again. The third one, DEFINITELY NOT. It’s one of those books that took off
on social media (TikTok, I think?) and I saw it online very frequently. So I gave it a try.
I love fantasy books but this one fell so so short of what I was hoping it would be. It was
extremely cliché and cringey. Violet enters the ruthless quadrant where you train to become
a dragon rider. It has a very repetitive theme of _"everyone here wants to kill me"_,
_"I’m going to die"_ and got excessively annoying. I absolutely don’t recommend.

The last book of 2023 that I positively loved was **Great Circle** by **Maggie Shipstead**.
The book is so beautifully written, the characters so real. The author tells the story of
Marian Graves, a fearless pilot in the 1940s, and weaves the present story of actress Hadley
Baxter, who ends up playing Marian Graves in a movie. The book draws from historical pilots
who undertook journeys across the globe, and is integrated with the fictitious story of Marian
perfectly, so much so that I would believe her to be real. I was captivated by Marian's desire
to fly, to go beyond the horizon. I loved how the life of Marian's twin brother, Jamie, was being
told in parallel to Marian's. Each character so intricate and genuine. When reading the chapters
of Hadley, all I could think about was Marian. What an epic tale. I highly recommend!

First book of 2024(!) - **The Rabbit Hutch** by **Tess Gunty** and I'm loving it!
