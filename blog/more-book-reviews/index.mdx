Ticked some books off my list. Here we go!

**Normal People** by **Sally Rooney** - I watched a bit when the series came out but couldn't quite finish it.
Similar experience with the book. I did end up reading till the end (not a fan of the ending) but it just didn't sit well with me.
The two main characters have a rollercoaster of a relationship. Marianne and Connell clearly have chemistry but a lot of issues.
Of course, that's real life and normal but it was a frustrating read. I was definitely not lured by the hype this book generated.
I was simply curious and really wanted to like this one, especially
after **Beautiful World, Where Are You** (which I loved!) but **Normal People** is one I would not recommend.

**Behold the Dreamers** by **Imbolo Mbue** - where do I begin? Absolutely loved this book. It's funny, dramatic, sad, all in one beautifully
told story of the experiences of two families during the 2008 financial crisis - an immigrant family full of hopes and dreams
when they arrive in America; and a wealthy family positioned in the upper classes of society. The story is so
innately human, the emotions are so real - you would empathize with each character. The struggles of both families and their intertwined
fates come to life. The focus is undoubtedly the story of Jende and Neni, the immigrant family, fighting hard to achieve the
'American Dream' and the extent to which they're willing to go. The unexpected journeys of the characters had me gripped.

**The Nightingale** by **Kristin Hannah** is the the story of two sisters in France during World War II. It's a heart-breaking tale of
love, war and everything in between. I couldn't put this down. This book gave me goosebumps. It talks about the brutality of war,
the suffering, the lives lost and the hope to get through it all. Vianne and Isabelle have a troubled past - the passing away of their mother;
their father having no sort of attachment to his daughters, not being man the girls once knew since WW1 and the death of this wife; and the sisters themselves not being there for each other when they were young.
Each play a pivotal
role in the war and embark on life-risking journeys of survival in Nazi occupied France. The writing is such a class act in itself.
Some paragraphs when talking about what it means to _love_ gave me chills. Hannah Kristin paints an authentic picture of what a city or town is reduced to in the midst of a war and the inhumanity that dominates; you can feel the events as described. You feel the fear, the courage and above all, the hope that both Vianne and Isabelle return to time and again. This book is a masterpiece.

Currently reading **Fairy Tale** by **Stephen King**. My first Stephen King book. Also, it's OctoberðŸŽƒ. I'm a hundred pages in
and Mr Bowditch and his ancient house give me 'Monster House' vibes (love it!) - so aptly autumn.
