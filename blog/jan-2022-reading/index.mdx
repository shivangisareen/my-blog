Last month, I finished two amazing books and statrted a third very captivating one. 

**Klara and the Sun** by **Kazuo Ishiguru** was such a breezy read. I finished it over a weekend (or something like that!). 
The events of the book are from the point of view of an _Artificial Friend_ (AF). It's become the norm for children to get AFs 
in the not-so-distant-future the book is set in.  Each AF has some unique quality; Klara is known for her observational prowess; 
every little detail she takes in, she tries to make more sense of the human world around her. The book takes us through her journey, 
from the store she’s displayed in, to the house of the child, Josie, who chooses her from across the street the very first time she 
laid eyes on Klara, her mission to save Josie, and finally a twisted end. I could not put this one down.

**Bewilderment** by **Richard Powers** - oh such a phenomenal read! I cannot stress enough what an amazing book this is. 
After every paragraph I read, I would re-read it just because every sentence is so beautifully written. What an incredible 
journey Powers takes the reader on - like poetry. The book is from the point of view of Theo Byrne, a scientist who is a widowed 
father of a distinctive and impulsive nine-year old boy, Robin. Robin is in a desperate attempt to save Earth and is appalled at 
the way grown-ups respond to the climate crisis and related events threatening other species. In only a few pages, it’s as if 
I **_know _** Robin - Powers has so magnificently captured the essence of characters. The book has so many noteworthy 
thoughts/sayings/remarks that I lost track. I didn’t want this book to end and I just could not put this one down. 
After finishing it, I sat in a moment of silence, realising what it took for life to reach this point and in complete awe of the 
miracle of life on Earth, how tiny we are compared to the cosmos and why are we not doing everything we can to save our planet. 


Currently reading **Cloud Cuckoo Land** by **Anthony Doerr**. More than halfway through and it is fascinating the way Doerr has taken 
five completely unrelated characters (decades apart) and weaved a story of them being connected by a centuries old piece of text, to navigate
the time they're in. Watch out for the review.
