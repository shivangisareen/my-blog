Here are 3 features of this site that have been really fun to implement and might prove to be useful
if you're starting out to create your own website!

**Note** this website is created using **GatsbyJS** and so some features are unique to it.

1. **CUSTOMIZING MARKDOWN COMPONENTS**

This website uses Gatsby's **data layer** to arrange and view blog posts and uses **GraphiQL** to explore
the data in the data layer. The blog posts are written in **Markdown**.

With `MDXProvider`, "_you can replace every HTML element that Markdown renders with a custom implementation._"

It's not mentioned in the GatsbyJS starter [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/), but talked about
[here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/customizing-components/). There's also a list of components that can be customized.

In the blog posts, you can see the bold text is coloured randomly; the anchor links appear in orange
instead of the default purple; and code blocks (take a look at the one below) have been customized
with a grey background colour and a certain padding.

This was possible using the `components` property of `MDXProvider`.

E.g.-

```
<MDXProvider
  components={{
    a: (props) => <a {...props} style={{ color: "orange" }} />,
    code: (props) => ...,
    ...
  }}
>
  <MDXRenderer>...</MDXRenderer>
</MDXProvider>
```

2. **DARK MODE TOGGLE**

The dark mode toggle (button on top left) implementation is on [Medium](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/setting-up-dark-mode-on-my-personal-website-300eb28c2c5c)
and is also referenced in my blog post ["Setting Up Dark Mode"](https://shivangisareen.com/blog/setting-up-dark-mode).

Once done with the basic set up, there's really no limit to how you can customize the look of the website in light vs dark mode!

**Next steps** - add animation to the dark mode toggle.

3. **BLOG CARD**

Initially I had a blog _list_ instead of displaying cards. This was very limiting, in terms of what I could display (only the title) and
didn't look that great.

With the cards, there's a colour element to it which definitely adds an appeal and chance for customization, and I've also displayed
the date the blog was posted and a one-liner summary giving more information to the reader at a glance.

The **BlogCard** itself was easy to implement using the [Card](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-card/) **MaterialUI** component; what
took a while was the styling in a grid layout and making it responsive.
