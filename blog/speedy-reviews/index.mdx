**Fairy Tale** by **Stephen King** is delightful! It lives up to its title. It’s a fight of good versus evil and a teenager, and his dog, caught up in it all. Without giving away any spoilers, it’s a wonderful book with a fairy tale ending, with magic, craftiness and a curse waiting to be lifted. I felt transported into an animated fantasy movie. And I loved the illustrations at the beginning of every chapter related to something you would read about in the following pages.

**Project Hail Mary** by **Andy Weir**. This has generated so much hype and I had great expectations from this book. But I really struggled to finish it. I like the plot. It’s very fast paced given the nature of the story - a mission to save humanity, crazy science experiments, meeting with an unexpected spacefarer - but I didn't grow any attachment towards the protagonist. Reading his story of how he came to be all alone in space made me think he lacked a lot of self-awareness which felt off-putting. A crisis after another, after a certain point, it was one too many, I couldn't follow the narrative, and the engineering solutions seemed far-fetched. Tried hard but no choice except to abandon this one.
