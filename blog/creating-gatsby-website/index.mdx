Hi there!

I did not know how much I would enjoy front-end development. I've always thought I wouldn't like it despite never having given it a try. But here I am now - completely in love with the whole process, the tools and the community.

I made this website using GatsbyJS. The basic foundation was built using the tutorial on the Gatsby website - highly recommend to anyone who's new to the field. It's a great way to get started after which you can keep building on top.

This blog is to share my love of reading and front-end web development!
